# Setting Up a Telegram Notification Server

#### Hello, TagUI enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹

As part of my commitment to supporting the community, Iâ€™ve set up a Telegram Notification server to enhance productivity and streamline updates for everyone. This server is designed to help automate notifications and make your workflows even smoother.

Iâ€™m excited to share this with all of you and would love to hear your thoughts. If thereâ€™s anything specific youâ€™d like to see added or any features you think could be helpful, feel free to let me know!

#### How to Use the Telegram Notification Server

To integrate the Telegram Notification server into your TagUI setup, follow these simple steps:

##### - Locate the File:
Open the file `tagui/src/tagui_header.js` in your TagUI installation directory.
##### - Modify the Endpoint:
Look for the line defining the Telegram endpoint. Update it to point to the new server:

```
var telegram_endpoint = 'https://tilyanpristka.id/taguibot';
```

#### Using Your Own Telegram Bot with TagUI

If youâ€™d prefer to use your own Telegram bot for notifications, follow these steps to set it up:

##### - Locate the File:

Open the file `tagui/src/tagui_header.js` in your TagUI installation directory.

##### - Add Your Telegram Token:

Find the line defining telegram_endpoint and add the following code directly beneath it:

```
var telegram_token = ''; // Replace with your bot's token
```

##### - Update the Telegram Intent Function:

Look for the `function telegram_intent($raw_intent)` in the same file and `tagui/src/tagui_parse.php`. In the function, replace `telegram_result` with the following code:

```
telegram_result = call_api(telegram_endpoint+'/sendMessage.php?chat_id='+telegram_chat_id+'&text='+telegram_message+'&token='+telegram_token);
```

##### - Save Your Changes:

Save the file after making these updates.

##### - Test Your Bot:

Run a TagUI workflow that includes Telegram notifications to confirm everything is working as expected.
